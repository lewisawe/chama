# ChamaPesa

A smart chama (savings group) management platform built for Kenya. ChamaPesa automates the tedious, error-prone work of running a chama — M-Pesa collections, rotating payouts, loan management, goal-based savings pools, and anonymous voting — so groups can focus on growing together.

## About

### The Problem

Over 300,000 chamas operate in Kenya, managing billions of shillings. Most run on spreadsheets, WhatsApp groups, and manual M-Pesa transfers. This leads to:

- **Missed contributions** — no automated reminders or collection
- **Trust issues** — opaque records, disputed payments, no audit trail
- **Manual payouts** — treasurers manually sending M-Pesa to rotation recipients
- **No accountability** — loan defaults go untracked, penalties unenforced
- **Exclusion** — members without smartphones can't participate in decisions

### The Solution

ChamaPesa digitizes the entire chama lifecycle:

- Members contribute via **M-Pesa STK Push** — triggered automatically or on demand
- **Merry-go-round payouts** are sent instantly via M-Pesa B2C to the next member in rotation
- **Loans** are requested, voted on anonymously, and disbursed automatically on approval
- A **trust score** (based on payment history, tenure, and participation) replaces subjective trust
- **Goal-based pools** let chamas split contributions across emergency funds, investments, and savings targets
- Every transaction is recorded with M-Pesa receipts for full transparency

## AWS Deployment

The app runs on AWS using ECS Fargate, RDS PostgreSQL, CloudFront (HTTPS), and an Application Load Balancer.

```
Internet → CloudFront (HTTPS) → ALB → /api/* → ECS (backend:3000)
                                     → /*    → ECS (dashboard:3001)
                                                    ↓
                                              RDS PostgreSQL (private subnet)
```

Infrastructure is defined in `infra/` using Terraform. See the deploy instructions in `infra/` or run:

```bash
cd infra && terraform apply -var-file="secrets.tfvars"
./deploy.sh
```

### CI/CD

Deployments are automated via **GitHub Actions**. Every push to `main` triggers the pipeline at `.github/workflows/deploy.yml`, which:

1. Builds and pushes Docker images to ECR
2. Rebuilds the dashboard with the production API URL
3. Forces ECS to redeploy both services

**Required GitHub Secrets:**

| Secret | Description |
|--------|-------------|
| `AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID` | IAM access key with ECR + ECS permissions |
| `AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY` | IAM secret key |
| `CLOUDFRONT_DOMAIN` | CloudFront distribution domain (e.g. `d1234abc.cloudfront.net`) |
